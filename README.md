# Convert-RibbonSbcConfigToWord.ps1

The name's a bit of a mouthful, but "Convert-RibbonSbcConfigToWord.ps1" takes the backup file from your Sonus/Ribbon SBC 1000/2000/SWeLite gateway and creates a new Word document, with all of the important(?) configuration information captured  in tables.&nbsp;
It started life as a way to save the tedium of screen-scraping lots of fixed frames for my as-built documents, but it quickly became apparent that it would also make a useful tool for the offline review of a gateway's config (although it ain't  no "UxBuilder").

## Features

- Decodes gateway versions up to 8.1.0 & SWe Lite. 

- Converts and saves the config to a new Word document, and optionally makes a PDF of it too. 

- Doesn't need any Lync PowerShell modules - it's fine on your Win7-Win10 machine (which needs to have Word installed). 

- Tested on Word 2010, 2013 & 2016. 

- Reasonably well debugged throughout (although time will tell of course!). 

- It's easy enough to turn off an unwanted section if you're only interested in a specific subset of the functionality, or are adapting to suit your environment. 

- Use the "RedactIP" switch to strip all IP addresses from the resulting file. 

- A "-SkipWrite" switch skips the relatively slow process of writing to Word. I added this for debugging and have left it in the released version to help anyone refining or enhancing the script. 

- From v2 the script has been signed, so no longer requires you to drop your ExecutionPolicy to "Unrestricted". This also means you can be confident the code's not changed since it left here. 

- Uses your existing Word document template for the formatting of the table headings and table of contents. 

## Limitations

- It's not the fastest to run! Stuffing values into Word is a relatively slow process. With all options enabled allow up to 10 minutes for your average gateway. I've stolen Scott Hanselman's "<a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ProgressBarsInPowerShell.aspx" target="_blank">Progress  Bars in PowerShell</a>" to help the watched pot boil. 

- v8.0 captures even more of the gateway's config than before, however it still doesn't capture EVERYTHING. There's an enormous amount in there, and it's growing with each release! If you find I've not captured a particularly  valuable element of the config, feel free to revise it to suit your needs - and send me the new bits to incorporate, please. If you're not feeling up to it, send me a sample config file and some screen-grabs of the bit you'd like to see added. 

- There are MANY hash tables throughout. (This is where an integer is stored in the config file, but it's decoded to text on-screen). I've put a lot of effort into capturing these, but there are going to be examples where I've missed one.  Please send me screen-grabs and sample config files and I'll update the script. 

- I'm largely letting Word control the width of the table columns, and you'll find many instances where it's done a poor job. You may need to edit every document the script produces to resolve this. 

## Instructions

* Backup your gateway, saving the config file somewhere accessible. Older gateway versions (pre 2.2.1) will save to an archive called "backup.tar.gz", while newer versions save as "SBC_Config_<hostname>_<version>_<date>.tar" 

* Older backups you'll need to unzip <em>twice</em> to recover the "symphonyconfig.xml" document we need, whilst newer ones only need one unzip to reveal their goodness <br /> >> If you have <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/" target="_blank">7-zip</a> installed you no longer need to unzip "SBC_Config_<hostname>_<version>_<date>.tar" - just feed the .tar file as the "-inputfile" 

* Open a PowerShell window 

* Now feed the backup into the script! Either place the config file in the same path as the script, give the full path in the command line, or a relative path:

```powershell 
PS H:\> Convert-RibbonSbcConfigToWord.ps1 -InputFile "symphonyconfig.xml" -OutputFile "CustomerSBC-config.docx"
```

If you don't specify an InputFile, the script goes looking for "symphonyconfig.xml" in its directory. If you don't specify an OutputFile, it will re-use the name of the InputFile and save as ".docx", overwriting any existing file of  the same name in that directory. If you add the "-MakePdf" switch, it will save the same output filename as a .pdf as well 

You can easily batch it:

```powershell
PS H:\> Get-ChildItem "d:\path\*.xml" -recurse | .\Convert-RibbonSbcConfigToWord.ps1 -IncludeNodeInfo -MakePdf -SkipUpdateCheck
```

```powershell
PS H:\> Get-ChildItem "d:\path\*.tar" -recurse | .\Convert-RibbonSbcConfigToWord.ps1 -MakePdf -SkipUpdateCheck
```

#### v8.1.5 16th August 2020
- Added display of SILK licences to the SweLite's System / Licensing / Current Licenses
- Now reports 'License Expiration' value from nodeinfo.txt for 1k/2k. (Was previously suppressed. I don't know why).
- Updated label on SweLite's License 'Virtual DSP Sessions' to 'Enhanced Media Sessions with Transcoding'
- Updated label on SweLite's License 'Proxy RTP <-> SRTP Sessions' to 'Enhanced Media Sessions without Transcoding'
- Removed test to suppress System / Node Level Settings / Country Level Information if SweLite: it's visible there now

- Changed license display: if not licenced, replace any '0' value with 'Not Licensed'
- Added new bits in 8.1.0 (SweLite) / 8.1.5 (1k/2k):
    - "Teams Local Media optimization" in SIP Sig Gps
    - Primary & Secondary Source to System / Node Level Settings / Domain Name Service
- Fixed bugs:
    - Updated input "$Fullname" to remove array declaration (Tks Mike.)
    - Some SBCs previously reported two blank lines between feature licences and the expiry, etc footer. Now back to just one.
    - SIP SigGp: Supported Audio Mode of "Proxy with local SRTP" & Proxy Local SRTP Crypto Profile ID should not show on a 1k/2k. Corrected.
					
#### v8.1.0B 18th March 2020

- Fixed bug where TT's were no longer arranged alphabetically - broken with the new layout introduced in v8.0.0. (Tks Mike.) 

#### v8.1.0 14th March 2020

- Restructured to support batch processing direct from the pipeline. Added new batch example:<br /> gci *.tar | .\Convert-RibbonSbcConfigToWord.ps1 -SkipUpdateCheck -MakePDF

### Help me improve the script

PLEASE let me know if you encounter any problems. All I ask is a copy of the .tar or symphonyconfig.xml file (de-identified as you wish), and a screen-grab from the browser to show me what it's <em>meant</em> to look like on-screen.
